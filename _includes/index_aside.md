Above you can see the <a href="http://www.sociopatterns.org/2009/09/live-social-semantics/">Live Social Semantics</a> installation with OpenBeacon tags. The intro music is from the song "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/geraintluff/dreamer?in=geraintluff/sets/sky-full-of-songs">Dreamer</a>" by <a href="http://geraintluff.co.uk/">Geraint Luff</a>. You can support his music <a href="http://geraintluff.co.uk/buy/">here</a>.
